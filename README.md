      fakeCMD
   </h1>
   fakeCMD is a fun command prompt recreation in python built to troll scambaiters. It has lots of little features to mess with scammers, and makes their commands work against them.

# Installation (READ CAREFULLY, NOT FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS)

This is not a fully fledged cmd clone, many functionalities will no longer work and your computer might break while 
fakeCMD is replaced for cmd. (This may be fixed in the future by having the backup cmd actually run the commands fakeCMD doesn't support.)

 - Click [Here](https://github.com/lioen-dev/fakeCMD/releases/latest)
 - Download the exe file.
 - Navigate to ```C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe```
 - Rename the original ```cmd.exe``` to ```cmd-backup.exe``` (You may need to gain permissions from TrustedInstaller to do this.)
 - Copy the downloaded ```cmd.exe``` file to ```System32```. (You may need to gain permissions from TrustedInstaller to do this.)
